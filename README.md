# Social Media-Inspired Recommendation System in Python

This project implements a command prompt-based console application that mimics the recommendation mechanisms seen in social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Google. It uses a hybrid approach combining collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques.

## Overview

The recommendation system suggests or predicts the interested topic of user to users based on their interactions and preferences. It is inspired by the sophisticated recommendation engines used by popular social media platforms.

## Features

- **User Interaction:** Users can input their preferences and interactions with items.
- **Hybrid Recommendations:** Combines collaborative filtering (based on user behavior) and content-based filtering (based on item attributes).
- **Command-Line Interface:** Simple console application with a user-friendly text-based interface.

## Inspiration
